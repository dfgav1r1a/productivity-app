# Productivity App

This full stack application is being developed using the MERN stack. This first commit contains the logic for GET and POST requests to READ and CREATE content. Logic will be added to implement full CRUD capabilities. 

I am planning on deploying this application using DOCKER, docker files will be added soon to this repository.

This README will be also updated properly as the application is developed further.
